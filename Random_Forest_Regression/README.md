A simple Random Forest Regression machine learning model for country's share of global world cup TV Audience by percentage.

## Results
This random forest regression model produces a mean absolute error (see below for definition) of about 0.2834099981618307, which is roughly 

# Background and How It Works
## Random Forest Regression
More coming soon!!! I'm also creating a standalone Decision Tree Regressor model for comparison to this model's results!

## Mean Absolute Error
This model's MAE based on current settings is about 0.283!
